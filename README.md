I am using lazy nvim.
it has git tools (lazy git) that helps you commit faster, it is better than
writing the whole commounds.
you can debuge your code too using debuge tools.
which key helpes you remember the keys.
nvim tree is a file explore.
and etc.

To download it
first download neovim in your terminal then create a folder called
".config" then navigate to there and type this command
"git clone [https://github.com/safa1904/nvim.git]"
that's it you got all the feauter.
