## üé® Custom Key Bindings

I have customized key bindings to streamline my workflow. Some notable ones include:

- `<leader> + w` - Save the current file.
- `<leader> + q` - Quit Neovim.
You can find the complete list of key bindings in the [keymapping.lua](lua/config/keymappings.lua) file.

## ‚ûï Additional Notes

- This configuration assumes you have Neovim 0.5 or later installed.

- Feel free to customize this configuration to fit your own preferences. The goal is to create a setup that works best for you.
